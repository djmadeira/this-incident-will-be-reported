## Feel ##
Cyberpunk, but desaturated. A dull, dying world that holds a vast and flourishing world of information.

As if the future took place in the late 90s.

Evil governments masked with incompetence.

## Setting ##
Takes place in the Miami, Florida in 2031.

### Global politics ###
US & UK government have followed their predictable courses toward big surveillance states. China has experienced huge economic growth, with their worst jobs now outsourced to India and Argentina. The West's hunger for more and cheaper has allowed them to grow very financially strong, although they continue to pollute the planet at an increasing rate.

The UN has officially put the "brakes" on global warming, or so they tell themselves, even as hurricanes increase year-on-year and crop returns reduce.

A global information board has been established to keep the public "safe" from "confusing information".

### Technology ###
The internet as we know it no longer exists. Major sites are sold in bundles like cable, with premiums placed on the consumer and producer end for access to independent sites. Most content is produced for the major platforms, (gTube for video, gTwitch for streaming video, Re:did for news and humor, and several others).

However, there exists a deep net that can be accessed by acquiring a Tor client. The Tor network, or the Tor, is mostly plain-text, although webs still exist on the secret web. Here, rebels and hackers congregate on sites like Hack News, Two Bit and nOwz. The deep web is also a place to share and download (or steal) software that is not or cannot be sold on the regular net.

Cloning is now possible, and has some military applications for designing dogs that are maximally useful in the field. However, human cloning is permitted only for government agencies and contractors, as authorities assert that that are certain side effects related to higher human functions associated with cloning humans.

Smart tech enthusiasts hang on to their hardware as long as possible, as the government asserts more control over manufacturers and puts limits on the kind of hardware available to consumers. A thriving 2nd hand and illegal homemade hardware market has sprung up in populated cities, and it is relatively easy for a connected person to commission a custom rig from one of these sources.

## Setup

The protagonist was a writer for the pirate portal nOwz. Their main stock & trade was haxpoz√®; hacking into the phones, websites or databases of people or corporations in power.

Before the story takes place, the protagonist was in the process of accessing information from a major entertainment corporation intercom, when she was discovered. Before she could jack out, they were able to fry her computer rig.

## Outline

Fade from black. Screen displays a message: RECOVERED FROM CRITICAL HARDWARE FAILURE. DATA CORRUPTED. FORMATTING DRIVE. Post-it note goes up: "pw: smashthestate".

Starter programs: help, list, install, whoami. Player explores the programs they have available, eventually using list and seeing the two files visible to them: read.program and crash.log. They figure out how to install the read program and use it to read the crash log.

The crash log contains clues to what happened and instructions to install the net program. When the player installs the net program, a sticky goes up "portal - net://etc", giving them a place to go next.

The portal contains netlocs to Hack News, a chatroom (empty), a search engine, and an anonymous file share service. When they connect to the file share service, they have to input the password from the sticky note to access. They are then given a list of files that were previously hosted:

  bookmarks.txt - links, passwords for nOwz writer portal
  parasite.pg - program for taking control of servers
  recover.pg - Program that reveals files on the computer: capture.pkg, sys.log

capture.pkg is encrypted, but sys.log gives more clues about what happened when the computer crashed (what it was connected to, what file was downloaded, and the user at the time of the crash).

In the chat room, somebody mentions a vulnerability in infocom's servers: a secret port that contains their internal message service. On this server can be found a couple of internal messages from employees, a decryption program, and the netloc and login for a secure channel to communicate with infocom's server maintenance bot.

Player can connect to the bot and answer some "security questions" of the bot in order to gain access to the secure server. Once accessed, they can learn more about infocom's AI tech as well as receive a decryption key for the previously downloaded packet.

As soon as the packet is decrypted, the screen flashes and the game makes creepy, screeching noises. The text flashes on screen: THIS INCIDENT WILL BE REPORTED. The screen blinks off, then comes back: everything is *almost* the same as before, but slightly creepy and off.

Lots of messages about how you've been identified and that the incident has been reported. Lots of dead-end clues. Maybe I'll add a "real" ending somewhere.

## Hacking

1. Scan for open ports
2.
